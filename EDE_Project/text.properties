medicaidDrawerContent=Important: The Marketplace doesn't offer Medicare Supplement Insurance (Medigap), Medicare Advantage (Part C) or other Medicare health plans, Medicare prescription drug coverage (Part D), or dental or vision coverage for people with Medicare. For information, visit Medicare.govIf you already have MedicareIt's against the law for anyone to sell you a Marketplace plan, and you aren't eligible for a premium tax credit or other savings.You can't drop Medicare and enroll in a Marketplace plan without significant penalties (including losing retiree or disability Social Security/Railroad Retirement benefits, and having to pay back any Social Security/Railroad Retirement benefits and Medicare claims payments you've received).If you pay a premium for Medicare Part A (Hospital Insurance): You can drop your Part A coverage (and Part B (Medical Insurance), if you have it) and enroll in a Marketplace plan instead \u2013 and you may be eligible for a premium tax credit and extra savings, depending on your income.See below if you have only Part A or only Part B coverage.If one spouse has Medicare and the other doesn'tContinue your Marketplace application to enroll the spouse without Medicare (and any household members who need coverage) in a Marketplace plan.Include in your household both spouses and all dependents, and include both spouses' income. (Marketplace savings are based on income for the household, not just those who need coverage.)Be sure to tell us that the spouse with Medicare doesn't need Marketplace coverage.The spouse with Medicare can't drop it to get a Marketplace plan, except as described above.If you're about to be eligible for Medicare and want a Marketplace plan insteadYou can enroll in a Marketplace plan. But you won't be eligible for savings based on your income. You'd have to pay full price for the Marketplace plan (unless you pay a premium for Part A).Before making this choice, also consider:If you enroll in Medicare after your Initial Enrollment Period (3 months before your 65th birthday month, your birthday month, and 3 months after your birthday), you may have to pay a penalty for as long as you have Medicare.Usually you can enroll in Medicare only during the Medicare General Enrollment Period (from January 1 \u2013 March 31). Your coverage won't begin until July 1 of that year.
